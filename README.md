# Solar Panel Efficiency Predictor ☀️

This project predicts the generated power of solar panels using environmental and weather parameters.

## Dataset Features
- Azimuth
- Zenith
- Angle of Incidence
- Wind Speed, Direction, Gust
- Cloud Cover (High, Medium, Low)

- Mean Sea Level Pressure
- Precipitation & Snowfall

## Workflow
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing
2. Exploratory data analysis (visualizations)
3. Feature scaling
4. Model training (Random Forest Regressor)
5. Model evaluation
6. Model saving for deployment

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
